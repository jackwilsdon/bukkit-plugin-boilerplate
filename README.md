# Bukkit Plugin Boilerplate
This boilerplate provides all of the basics to get your plugin up and running in the shortest amount of time possible.

## Modifying
The name, description and version of the plugin can be found in `gradle.properties`.

To change the package of your plugin from `com.example.boilerplate`, first rename the package directories and then update `src/main/resources/plugin.yml` to match.

## Building
### Building on Windows
 1. Open a command prompt in the boilerplate folder and run `gradlew build`.

### Building on MacOS or Linux
 2. Open a terminal in the boilerplate folder and run `gradlew build`.
